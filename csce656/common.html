                    I found many common interests and reasons for taking this class from my classmates' websites. Here is a brief summary.

                <div class="section">
                    I took this course because of my interest in user interface development, and it seems that many 
                    other students are interested in human-computer interaction and the applications as well. For example, <a href="http://students.cse.tamu.edu/nishant.barma/">Nishant</a>
                    is interested in how AI improves the interaction, and <a href="https://leyihucsce656.blogspot.com/">Leyi</a> and <a href="http://students.cse.tamu.edu/zhengkai9/">Kai</a> would
                    also like to learn more about various issues in HCI.

                <div class="section">
                    In terms of common interests, first of all, it seems that everyone spends a lot of time on social networks like Facebook or Twitter, and
                    many of us are huge YouTube videos consumers. Social news platforms like Reddit and Hacker News also attract many of us in this class, including 
                    <a href="http://students.cse.tamu.edu/zhengkai9/">Kai</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~doddapanenipc/">Purna</a>, <a href="http://students.cse.tamu.edu/jacobfenger/656/">Jacob</a>, and <a href="https://neil-gibeaut-webpage.herokuapp.com/index.html">Neil</a>.
                    Apart from that, <a href="https://neil-gibeaut-webpage.herokuapp.com/index.html">Neil</a> and I both listen to a lot of podcasts.
                    Music is another common interest for most of the students in this course.

                <div class="section">
                    I also share the same interest with many people when it comes to video games. <a href="http://students.cse.tamu.edu/nishant.barma/">Nishant</a> and I are both
                    into historical strategy games, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/yang-csce-656-home-page/home">Yang</a>'s interest in sandbox games also resonate well with mine.
