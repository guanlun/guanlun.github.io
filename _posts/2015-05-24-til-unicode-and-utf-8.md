* Unicode is a character set. It specifies how codepoints (numbers) are mapping to characters but does not specify how numbers are stored as bits.
* UTF-8 is an encoding. It specified how codepoints are stored at bits. UTF-8 encoded characters can be 1 to 4 bytes long.
* UTF-16 is also a variable length encoding method and it starts with 2 bytes.
